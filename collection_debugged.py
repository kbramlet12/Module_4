#Program Name: collection.py
# Purpose of a program:
# Create a collection of authors and the years they died using a dictionary.
# Print the collection in the following format:

# Charles Dickens, 1870
# William Thackeray, 1863
# Anthony Trollope, 1882
# Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1889

authors = dict({1: 'Charles Dickens, 1870', 2: 'William Thackeray, 1863', 3: 'Anthony Trollope, 1882', 4: 'Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1889'})

print(authors[1])
print(authors[2])
print(authors[3])
print(authors[4])



#1 The first thing I did was run the program to see whats up.
#2 I started fixing basic syntax errors and tried to format the dictionary correctly.
#3 After creating the dictionary how I would have I aimed to print the outputs in the format expected. Time to run the program for the first time after all of the changes.
#4 It worked!
